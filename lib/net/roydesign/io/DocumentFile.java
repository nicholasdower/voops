/**
 * <p>A document file is a file meant to be opened in an application. Most
 * platforms have their own way of binding a document to an application,
 * and this class attempts to incorporate the smarts for those varied
 * mechanisms. Of interest is the fact that all methods in this class
 * are cross-platform, even the methods specific to a particular OS. Those
 * methods will simply not do anything, or will act on an internal member
 * variable. In any case, this allows your code to be free of ugly platform
 * checks.</p>
 *
 * <p>In particular, this class supports the Mac OS type/creator binding
 * mechanism. Even though the methods are specific to the Mac OS, they can
 * be called on any platform. For example, calling <code>setMacCreator("ABCD")</code>
 * won't put this information in the file system as it would on Mac OS, but
 * it will still be tracked internally, so that a subsequent call to
 * <code>getMacCreator()</code> will return the set value. This ensures that
 * your code runs unchanged on all platforms.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class also exposes methods to easily change the filename extension
 * of the document on disk. This is meant as an equivalent to the Mac specific
 * type/creator facility so that the type and binding of a document can be
 * set on platforms other that Mac OS.</p>
 *
 * <p>The document can be renamed, and this translates into the file
 * on disk to be renamed as well. This is a convenience over having to use
 * the <code>File.renameTo(File)</code> method and its associated pitfalls.</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally this class also makes it easy to open a document, either as
 * though the user had double-clicked it in the file system, using its default
 * binding, or with a given application of your choice. This functionality is
 * typically highly platform dependent and error prone. Using this class makes
 * it simple. All you have to do is <code>new DocumentFile(myFile).open()</code>.</p>
