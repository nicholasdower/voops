/**
 * <p>A subclass of <code>javax.swing.JMenuBar</code> that adds the logistics
 * needed to make menu bars conform to the Mac OS screen menu bar requirements
 * without sacrificing the usual way of presenting menu bars on other platforms.
 * On Mac OS and Mac OS X, the menu bar sits at the top of the screen, contrary
 * to other platforms that locate a distinct menu bar in each frame. This
 * difference in UI design makes it challenging to write code that gracefully
 * handles all platforms, and this class, along with <code>JScreenMenu</code>
 * and <code>JScreenMenuItem</code> improve on the existing Swing classes to
 * fill the gap.</p>
 *
 * <p>This works with the introduction of a concept called user frames. The word
 * "user" here doesn't refer to the computer user but rather to frames that make
 * use of a menu and a menu item. Rather then if/elsing your code when constructing
 * your menu bars to handle different platforms, you simply code one menu bar where
 * you specify which menus and menu items are actually used by which frame classes.
 * With this in place, you just add an instance of the menu bar to all your frames,
 * and it will automatically decide by itself which menus and menu items should be
 * visible or not, and enabled or not, depending on the current platform and whether
 * the screen menu bar is used. This is all done via the method
 * <code>addUserFrame()</code> in the <code>JScreenMenu</code> and
 * <code>JScreenMenuItem</code> classes. The behavior is as follows. On the Mac
 * with the screen menu bar in use, when the host frame is not a user frame,
 * then the menu or menu item is simply disabled. On other platforms, the menu
 * is instead removed. This satisfies the requirement of having an all-inclusive
 * menu bar on the Mac while allowing distinct menu bars on other platforms.</p>
 *
 * <p>Typically, the most convenient way of using these classes is to subclass
 * <code>JScreenMenuBar</code> and then instantiate it for each of your frames.<p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyMenuBar extends JScreenMenuBar
 * {
 *     public MyMenuBar()
 *     {
 *         // All frames get this menu
 *         JScreenMenu m = new JScreenMenu("Foo");
 *         add(m);
 *         
 *         // Even though all frames get the Foo menu, only
 *         // MyFrame gets this menu item
 *         JScreenMenuItem mi = new JScreenMenuItem("Hello");
 *         mi.addUserFrame(MyFrame.class);
 *         m.add(mi);
 *         
 *         // Just MyFrame and MyFrameToo get this menu
 *         m = new JScreenMenu("Bar");
 *         m.addUserFrame(MyFrame.class);
 *         m.addUserFrame(MyFrameToo.class);
 *         add(m);
 *         
 *         // And all frames that get the Bar menu get
 *         // this menu item
 *         mi = new JScreenMenuItem("Bye Bye");
 *         m.add(mi);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>It's important to mention that this set of menu classes doesn't provide
 * support for shared menus, which developers sometimes request. A shared menu
 * shares its state within all its displayed instances, meaning for example that
 * if you disable it, all its instances will be disabled, which might or might
 * not be what you desire, especially in the context of a document-based user
 * interface. On the contrary, this set of classes creates separate instances
 * of menus and menu items, each with its own state, even though they might all 
 * look like the same menu to the user, particularly on Mac OS.</p>
